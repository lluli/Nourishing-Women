                1 small white onion, halved

                2 serrano chiles, stems removed

                <br>

                Warm corn tortillas, chopped white onion, and lime wedges (for serving)
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="Method">
            <h1 class="Method-Title">Method</h1>
            <p>
            <h5>Step One</h5>
            Combine garlic, cilantro, orange juice, lager, lime juice, oil, salt, pepper, vinegar, cumin, and chile
            powder in a large baking dish. Add steak and turn to coat in marinade. Cover and chill, turning
            occasionally, at least 10 hours and up to 1 day.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Two</h5>
            Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Grill onion halves, chiles, and tomatillos, turning often,
            until charred and tender, 10-15 minutes for onion and tomatillos, 8-12 minutes for chiles.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Three</h5>
            Transfer vegetables to a blender and add garlic, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, 1 cup
            cilantro, and 3 Tbsp. oil. Carefully blend until salsa is mostly smooth (some texture is good but make sure
            there are no large chunks).
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Four</h5>
            Remove steak from marinade, letting excess drip back into dish (or bag); discard marinade. Grill steak,
            turning every minute or so, until charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part
            registers 140° for medium, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Five</h5>
            Thinly slice steak against the grain, then cut into bite-size pieces. Transfer to a bowl and sprinkle with
            sea salt.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Six</h5>
            Top tortillas with some steak, salsa, cilantro, and chopped onion. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over
            and remaining salsa alongside.
