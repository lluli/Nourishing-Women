        <div class="Ingredients">
            <h1 class="Ingredients-Title">Ingredients</h1>
            <p>
            <h5>Serves 4</h5>
            <br><br>
            1 lb. short tube pasta (such as paccheri or rigatoni)
            <br><br>
            Kosher salt
            <br><br>
            8 Tbsp. (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, divided
            <br><br>
            1 small regular lemon or Meyer lemon, very thinly sliced into rounds, seeds removed
            <br><br>
            1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated, plus more for serving
            <br><br>
            Freshly ground black pepper
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="Method">
            <h1 class="Method-Title">Method</h1>
            <p>
            <h5>Step One</h5>
            Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling generously salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al
            dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions (pasta will finish cooking in the sauce).
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Two</h5>
            Meanwhile, heat half of the butter in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium until melted.
            Add lemon slices and cook, stirring often, until softened and bottom of pot is browned in spots, 5-7
            minutes. Using tongs, transfer one-third of lemon slices to a plate; set aside.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Three</h5>
            Just before pasta is al dente, scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking liquid. Add 1Â½ cups pasta cooking liquid
            to butter sauce. (This may seem like a lot of liquid, but it will thicken once the remaining ingredients
            are added.) Add remaining butter a piece at a time, whisking until each piece is incorporated before
            adding more, until the sauce is emulsified and creamy.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Four</h5>
            Drain pasta and add to sauce. Cook, stirring often and adding 1 oz. Parmesan a little at a time. Once
            all of the cheese is added, continue to cook, still stirring, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy
            and clings to pasta, about 3 minutes. If sauce looks very thick, add more pasta cooking liquid 1-2 Tbsp.
            at a time to thin (saucier is ideal as it will thicken as it cools). Remove from heat and sprinkle with
            an almost ridiculous amount of pepper (about 2 tsp.); toss once more.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Five</h5>
            Serve pasta topped with reserved lemon rounds and more Parmesan
