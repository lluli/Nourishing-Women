    <div id="Recipe">


        <div class="Ingredients">
            <h1 class="Ingredients-Title">Ingredients</h1>
            <p>
            1/2 cup oil or ghee
            <br>
            550g chicken, bone in and cut into curry pieces
            <br>
            600g tomatoes, finely chopped
            <br>
            1 bulb garlic, minced
            <br>
            2 tbsp ginger, minced
            <br>
            1-2 tsp salt, or to taste
            <br>
            2 tsp paprika/kashmiri red chilli
            <br>
            1.5 tsp crushed black pepper
            <br>
            1 tsp chilli flakes
            <br>
            0.5 tsp cumin powder
            <br>
            0.5 tsp coriander powder
            <br>
            1tsp kalonji (black seed, optional)
            <br>
            2 green chillis, slit in half lengthwise
            <br>
            0.5 bunch coriander, chopped
            <br>
            1/4 cup ginger cut into matchstick pieces
        </p>
        </div>



        <div class="Method">
            <h1 class="Method-Title">Method</h1>
            <p>
                Heat up your oil in a karahi dish, wok, cast iron skillet or any pan suitable for stirfrying, keeping
                the
                flame on high for the entire duration
                <br><br>
                Add the chicken in. Fry this, stirring constantly until the chicken begins to take on a golden colour in
                some places
                <br><br>
                Add in the minced ginger and garlic. Give this a fry alongside the chicken, again stirring constantly
                and
                ensuring nothing burns. Continue to fry this until the raw smell of the ginger and garlic begins to fade
                <br><br>
                Add all the chopped tomatoes and spices. Stir in and allow this all to cook on high, stirring to ensure
                nothing catches at the bottom of the pan
                <br><br>
                Continue to cook this mix for about 20 minutes. The oil will separate, the tomatoes will thicken and
                begin
                to coat the chicken, and you will see holes begin to bubble in the gravy. The chicken should be cooked
                through at this point
                <br><br>
                Add the coriander and green chillis, stir in, turn the heat down to a low flame and allow everything to
                simmer together for 5 minutes without putting the lid on
                <br><br>
                Serve with the matchstick-cut ginger and additional coriander/green chilli if desired
            </p>
