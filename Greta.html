        Chocolate Chip Cookie
    </div>

    <div id="Intro">
        Just as Greta Thunberg has fearlessly spoken up for the planet, these Chocolate Chip Cookies combine classic
        flavors and a sustainable twist. The rich chocolate morsels represent the sweetness of her message, while the
        mindful choice of organic and ethically sourced ingredients reflects her dedication to a more sustainable
        future.
        <br><br>
        As you mix the dough and the aroma of freshly baked cookies fills the air, let it remind you of Greta's call for
        global change. Each bite of these warm and gooey treats is a small reminder that every action, no matter how
        seemingly insignificant, can contribute to a more sustainable world.
        <br><br>
        Just as Greta's words have sparked a global movement, these Chocolate Chip Cookies invite you to indulge in a
        moment of sweetness and reflect on the power of collective action. Share them with loved ones, sparking
        conversations about the importance of environmental stewardship and inspiring others to make a difference.

            <h1 class="Ingredients-Title">Ingredients</h1>
            <p>
                <h5>Makes 12</h5>
                <br><br>
                100g  granulated sugar
                <br><br>
                165g brown sugar, packed
                <br><br>
                1 teaspoon salt
                <br><br>
                115ml unsalted butter, melted
                <br><br>
                1 egg
                <br><br>
                1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                <br><br>
                155g all-purpose flour
                <br><br>
                ½ teaspoon baking soda
                <br><br>
                110g milk chocolate chunks
                <br><br>
                100g dark chocolate chunk
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="Method">
            <h1 class="Method-Title">Method</h1>
            <p>
                <h5>Step One</h5>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Two</h5>
                Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Three</h5>
                Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Four</h5>
                Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Five</h5>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Six</h5>
                Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Seven</h5>
                Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
