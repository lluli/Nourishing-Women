        Lemon olive oil cake
    </div>

    <div id="Intro">

        Just as Zaha Hadid pushed the boundaries of design and challenged conventions, this Lemon Olive Oil Cake pushes
        the boundaries of traditional baking to create a dessert that is as bold and unique as her architectural
        creations. The marriage of bright lemon and delicate olive oil creates a symphony of flavors that dance on your
        palate.
        <br><br>
        Hadid's groundbreaking architectural designs often featured bold curves and sleek lines, and this cake embodies
        that same sense of elegance and modernity. The tender crumb and citrusy notes of the cake are a testament to her
        ability to blend creativity with functionality.
        <br><br>
        With every forkful, let the vibrant lemon zest and the richness of olive oil transport you to the awe-inspiring
        world of Zaha Hadid's architectural wonders. Just as her designs evoke a sense of wonder and awe, this Lemon
        Olive Oil Cake will ignite your senses and leave you craving more.

        <div class="Ingredients">
            <h1 class="Ingredients-Title">Ingredients</h1>
            <p>
            <h5>Serves 6-8</h5>
            <br><br>
            1½ cups extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan
            <br><br>
            3 large eggs
            <br><br>
            1¼ cups (250 g) plus 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar
            <br><br>
            1¼ cups whole milk
            <br><br>
            2 tsp. vanilla extract
            <br><br>
            Zest and juice of 2 lemons; plus more zest for serving (optional)
            <br><br>
            2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour
            <br><br>
            ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
            <br><br>
            ½ tsp. baking powder
            <br><br>
            ½ tsp. baking soda
            <br><br>
            Powdered sugar (for serving)

            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="Method">
            <h1 class="Method-Title">Method</h1>
            <p>
                <h5>Step One</h5>
                Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly oil pan with a pastry brush. Line bottom with a parchment paper round and
                brush parchment with oil. Whisk eggs, 1½ cups oil, and 1¼ cups sugar in a medium bowl until smooth. Add
                milk, vanilla, and zest and juice of 2 lemons and whisk to combine.
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Two</h5>
                Whisk flour, salt, baking powder,
                and baking soda in a large bowl to combine. Make a well in the center and gradually pour egg mixture
                into well. Whisk, using circular motions to slowly incorporate egg mixture, until batter is mostly
                smooth (some lumps are okay). Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface. Sprinkle remaining 1
                Tbsp. sugar over.
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Three</h5>
                Bake cake until top is golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out
                clean, about 50 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool before unmolding.
                Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
                <br><br><br><h5>Step Four</h5>
                Just before serving, dust cake with powdered sugar and top with more lemon zest if you have it.
                <br><br><br>
                <h5>Do ahead:</h5> Cake can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
