        Tuna Niçoise Salad
    </div>

    <div id="Intro">
        Just as Jane Goodall has immersed herself in the natural world, studying and advocating for the protection of
        chimpanzees and their habitats, this Tuna Niçoise Salad embraces the vibrant colors and fresh ingredients found
        in nature. It combines succulent tuna, crisp vegetables, briny olives, and perfectly boiled eggs to create a
        harmonious medley of flavors and textures.
        <br><br>
        This salad, like Jane Goodall's work, celebrates the interconnectedness of our planet. The combination of
        ingredients represents the diversity and beauty of nature, reminding us of the importance of sustainable
        practices and cherishing the resources that the Earth provides.
        <br><br>
        As you savor each bite of this refreshing salad, let the tangy vinaigrette awaken your taste buds and transport
        you to the sun-kissed shores of the Mediterranean. Just as Jane Goodall's observations have transformed our
        understanding of the animal kingdom, this Tuna Niçoise Salad will leave you feeling nourished and connected to
        the natural world.

        <div class="Ingredients">
            <h1 class="Ingredients-Title">Ingredients</h1>
            <p>
            <h5>Serves 6-8</h5>

            ¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil
            <br><br>
            ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
            <br><br>
            2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
            <br><br>
            1 tsp. honey
            <br><br>
            1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
            <br><br>
            1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
            <br><br>
            6 large eggs
            <br><br>
            1 lb. green beans, trimmed and/or new or baby potatoes, halved if larger
            <br><br>
            4 cups thinly sliced seedless cucumbers
            <br><br>
            3 cups oil-packed tuna
            <br><br>
            Olives, capers, peperoncini, pickles, anchovies, or other pickled-briny ingredients, drained well (for
            serving)
            <br><br>
            Flaky sea salt
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="Method">
            <h1 class="Method-Title">Method</h1>
            <p>
            <h5>Step One</h5>
            Whisk ¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil, ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, 1 tsp. honey, 1 tsp.
            freshly ground black pepper, and 1 tsp. kosher salt in a medium bowl; set niçoise salad dressing aside.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Two</h5>
            Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add 6 large eggs and cook 7 minutes. Using a
            slotted spoon, transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water (keep pot over high heat); chill eggs until cold,
            about 5 minutes. Peel; set aside.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Three</h5>
            Meanwhile, add 1 lb. green beans, trimmed and/or new or baby potatoes, halved if larger to the same pot
            of boiling water and cook until just tender, 2-4 minutes for green beans, 10-15 minutes for potatoes.
            Using a slotted spoon, transfer to bowl of ice water; let sit until cold, about 3 minutes. Transfer to
            paper towels; pat dry.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Step Four</h5>
            To serve, slice eggs in half and arrange on a large platter with green beans
            and/or potatoes, 4 cups seedless cucumbers, thinly sliced on a diagonal, and 3 cups oil-packed tuna. Top
            with olives, capers, peperoncini, pickles, anchovies, or other pickled-briny things, drained well,
            sprinkle with flaky sea salt, and drizzle some reserved dressing over. Serve with remaining dressing
            alongside.
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>Do Ahead:</h5> Niçoise salad dressing can be made 5 days ahead; cover and chill. Eggs can be
            boiled and vegetables blanched 2 days ahead; cover and chill separately.
